        Let <m>f</m>  be a real-valued function with domain <m>D\subseteq \mathbb{R}</m>, and suppose <m>f</m> is differentiable at every interior point in <m>D</m>, and left- or right-differentiable at every endpoint of <m>D</m>. Then <m>f</m> is called <term>differentiable on its domain</term> (or simply <term>differentiable</term>).

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m>  be a real-valued function with domain <m>D\subseteq \mathbb{R}</m>, and suppose <m>f</m> is differentiable. Then we can define a real-valued function <m>f'(x):D \to \mathbb{R}</m> as follows.
