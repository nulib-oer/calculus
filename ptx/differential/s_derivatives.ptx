        Let <m>f</m> be a real-valued function whose domain <m>D</m> is a union of intervals. We say <m>f</m> is <term>differentiable on <m>D</m></term> (or simply <term>differentiable</term>) if it is differentiable at all points of <m>D</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m>  be differentiable on its domain <m>D</m>, and assume <m>D</m> is a union of open intervals. The <term>derivative of <m>f</m></term> is the function
        <me>
          f'\colon D\rightarrow \mathbb{R}
        </me>
        that assigns to each input <m>x\in D</m> the derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>x</m>. (COMMENT: could possibly adapt to accommodate left- right endpoints).
